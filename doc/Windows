First, we'll install cygwin and some dependency:
    bash 
    xterm
    xorg-server
    ncurses
    x-start-menu-icons
    xedit (optional)
    tar (optional)

Now, we install aircrack-ng in cygwin's bin directory. (Just copy the .exe and airmon-ng there)
Now we'll install airoscript:

::

    make


:-D Just that.
Now, we configure aiorscript for using airserv-ng (put WIFI=localhost:666) editing it with xedit (that's because I told to install xedit, but you can use others)

Now we start X server from start menu
Start airserv-ng with commview library for inyection (if supported, note this won't work on most systems)(Even aircrack-ng won't work on some systems/wifi cards)

And now, from cygwin shell we just type: airoscript
NOTE: We'll have to set DISPLAY variable before starting airoscript, use export DISPLAY=:0 or put it on your .bashrc
Oh! And tell airoscript to not put interface in monitor mode ok?
