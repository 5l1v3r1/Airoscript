REQUIREMENTS
============

    - GNU gettext (gettext package)
    - ip (iproute package)
    - aircrack-ng (same version as airoscript-ng)
    - *Working* injection capable driver for the interface you want to use

    Build-deps: gettext
    Deps:   Terminal emulator (mrxvt, xterm...) -> Preferibly xterm
		Aircrack-ng > 1.0.2
		Bash
		wlandecrypter (optional)
		jazzteldecrypter (optional)
		mdk (optional)
		GNU Tools like grep awk...
		macchanger (optional, highly recommended)

COMPILING:
==========

    You have to identify where your aircrack-ng installation is.
    It can be on /usr or on /usr/local
        Hint: packages are usually in /usr, if you installed
        it manually it should be in /usr/local

    You can specify the paths for aircrack-ng if you need so, just do:

    ::

        make aircrack_prefix="\/foo\/bar"
    
    Don't forget to scape (\) the slashes, like in the example.

    Note: On slackware you'll need dhclient or config airoscript 
          to use dhcpdb instead

FEATURES
========

    Airoscript is fully i10n (currently translated to spanish), configurable,
    themable and modular. 


DEBIAN
=======
    There is a file regarding debian packaging, if you're going to package 
    airoscript for debian.

PROBLEMS
========
    If something fails when trying to use dhcp, check that you have dhclient
    installed, if dhclient is not your client, just change $DHCPSOFT var on 
    config file for your dhcp client software.
