You have to identify where your aircrack-ng installation is.
It can be on /usr or on /usr/local
    Hint: packages are usually in /usr, if you installed
    it manually it should be in /usr/local

If you're on debian or slackware you can just exec
    make [debian/slackware]

Otherwise, do:
    make aircrack_prefix="\/foo\/bar"
    Don't forget to scape (\) the slashes, like in the example.
